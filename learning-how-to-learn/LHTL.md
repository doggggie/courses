* hindering actions: procrastination, over-learning, Einstellung, choking, multi-tasking, illusions of learning, lack of sleep
* test preparation
* importance of mindset

-------------------------

### 1. What is Learning

#### Focused vs Diffuse Thinking

Focused vs diffuse thinking - think about pinball game, tightly vs widely placed bumpers. Either one of the other, they can't be present at the same time. When you try to learn something new -> **diffuse** thinking. When you work through a problem step-by-step -> **focused** thinking.

**Metaphors** / analogys are powerful techniques for learning. 

Learning takes time, **build up** every day. 

To go into diffuse mode - try something that makes yur mind **relaxing**, e.g. going for a walk, running, taking a shower, bus ride, sitting on sofa...  **TODO**


#### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

**Getting through the initial neural discomfort** is important in preventing procrastination, as it will disappear once you start working. 

Pomodoro - 25 min, **no interuptions**, focus, *reward!*

Turn off: cellphone, internet connections, any interuptions...  **TODO**

Practice makes permanent. Focus for a while then **take a break** (e.g. **exercise**, jog, shower, relax) for a short period, when diffuse mode might be active and helps you to better understand what you've just learned. 

Long-time vs working memory (~4 slots): it takes time to move from working to long time memory. Technique: **spaced repetition** - repeat things over a number of days. **TODO - TRY IT**

**Sleep**: detoxin brain, strengthen important parts of memories, erases unimportant ones, rehearse difficult materials. It helps to **rehearse important materials before sleeping**. 


-------------------------

### 2. Chunking

Big picture (connections) over small details. 

Mini-chunks -> chunks -> even-larger chunks. 

Chunks are formed by practice and repetition. 

To Form a chunk: **focus** your undivided attention on the info you want to chunk; **understand** the idea you want to chunk (but this doesn't mean you can DO it, **practice** yourself (when you close the book for example); gain **context**. 

Bottom up learning - chunking; top down learning - big picture; context is where the two meet. 

Try taking a "**picture walk**" through the material to gain big picture context before diving into details. 

**Recall** (mini-testing): mental retrieval of key ideas, is more powerful than reread. Recalling in a different physical environment is helpful. 

Keep highlighting and underlining to a minimum (1 sentence in a paragraph at most); write key concepts on the margin works better. 

Making mistakes is a good thing, as it helps you to learn better. 

**Deliberate practice**: focus on the difficult. 

Einstellung: initial idea keeps you away from better solution. 

**Interleaving**: mix up different materials, builds flexibility and creativity, and helps you to learn more deeply. 


-------------------------

### 3. Procrastination and Memory

Procrastination and memory are intimately related because building solid chunks of long-term memory (which are easily accessible by short-term memory) takes time, and won't happen if you put off till the last minute. 

Tackling procrastination is easier and more valuable than you think. 

You only feel better **temporarily** if you procrastinate, but it has very bad effects in the long-term, and influences many areas of life. 

4 parts of **habits**

* **cue** - launch you into zombie mode (e.g. seeing the first item in your to-do list); 
* **routine** - zombie mode, can be useful or harmful; 
* **reward** - important in preventing procrastination if good habits are rewarded; 
* **belief** - change your underlying belief, no more excuse for yourself. 

Tell yourself - quite wasting your time, you'll feel better soon! 

#### Process vs Product

**Process** - flow of time, related to simple habits.

**Product** - outcome. 

Focus on process (the short period, use a **Pomodoro**) and forget about product if you need to do unpleasant tasks, because the zombie part in the brain likes processes more. 

Avoid distractions (quiet space, noise-canceling headphones can be helpful when you really try to concentrate). 


#### Harness Your Zombie to Help You (while minimizing willpower use) 

Trick to overriding a habit

* cue - location, time, how you feel, reactions (e.g. look sth up online -> websurfing, text msg -> taking 10 min to get back to studying, sln: shut cellphone & internet); 

* reaction - have a plan (leave cellphone at home when you study, study in a quiet spot in the lib); 

* reward - important, think about some for you (**TODO**); 

* belief - that you can do it. 

#### Juggling Life and Learning

**Plan**: write down list of daily & weekly (small) key tasks on a journal, better in the evening **before** (free up some of your working memory), then work on them with pomodoro. 

**Mixing up** your tasks, mental and physical, as a switch between focused and diffuse modes.  

Plan a quitting time and **take breaks**. 

Try to work on the **most difficult and unpleasant task first**, at least one pomodoro. 

Record what does/doesn't work. 

Build up day by day, avoid procrastination which leads to cramming before deadline. 

#### Procrastination Summary

* Keep a plannar journal
* Commit to certain routines and tasks every day
* Delay rewards till you finish the task
* Watch for procrastination cues
* Gain trust in your new system
* Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate
* Eat your frogs first


#### Diving Deeper into Memory

**Images** help you to memorize concepts. 

Working -> long term memory - spaced repetitions. 

**Index cards** can be helpful: keyword on one side, detailed info on the other: words, graphs, equations... Interleave the cards. Review them before sleep. Briefly review for a few days (e.g. in the morning/evening). Gradually extend the time between reps. 


#### Long Term Memory

Short term memory (active state) -- consolidation --> long term memory (inactive state) -- reactivation --> short term memory; reconsolidation. [Re]consolidation also occur during sleep. 

It's more effective to space learning over time than mass learning. 


#### Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique

Associating numbers and words with meaningful things helps to memorize. 

Use familiar place to associate a group of things needed to be memorized; use visualization. This also builds **creativity**. 

It may take long initially, but will improve later on. 

#### Memory Summary

* Long term memory - storage warehouse, build up
* Working memory - poor blackboard, quickly erases itself, plan ahead to save slots
* Visualization, imagination, use your (fun, evocative) senses to remember
* Create meaningful groups (for unrelated items)
* Handwriting helps you to more deeply encode what you are trying to learn

### 4. Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

#### Introduction to Renaissance Learning Unlocking Your Potential

**Exercise and exposure to new environments or ideas** (e.g. trying a new route to get to work, learn a new skill like fixing the plumbing in the sink) helps new neurons survive, and helps you to learn better. 

* Learn using **metaphor and analogy** and stories - useful for getting out of Einstellung; it's often helpful to pretend YOU are the concept that you are tring to understand.  
* Work profitably with teammates.
* Perform well on tests.

Back on chunking - well train intuition is like deeply ingrained repertoire of chunks. **Understand** things, rather than simply take it from books/someone else. 

**No Need for Genius Envy**: superb working memory (e.g. 9 slots) --> maybe not so creative, due to Einstellung - it holds its thoughts so tightly. Everyone has different gifts. **Imposter syndrome**: frequent feeling of inadequacy. 

*Take pride in who you are, esp in the qualities that make you different, and use them as a secret talisman for success. Use your natural contrariness to defy the always present prejudices from others about what you can accomplish.* 

#### The Value of Teamwork

Right hemisphere: global, context-dependent thinking style, getting into the right track and doing reality checks. Left hemisphere: cling to the existing, over-confidence. Go back and revisit from a global view. 

Everyone has blind spots. Work with a teammate - catch what you missed. **Study groups** can be very helpful (not social groups...)

#### A Test Checklist

You learn far more by taking a test than reading a book for the same amount of time. 

* Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
* Did you work with classmates on homework problems?
* Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution?
* Did you participate actively in homework group discussions?
* Did you consult with the instructor?
* Did you understand all of your homework solutions?
* A study guide? 
* Outline problem solutions quickly?
* A review session?
* A reasonable night of sleep before test? 

#### Hard Start - Jump to Easy

First look at hard problems so that you can access the diffuse mode for them. Switch between easy and hard problems. 

Deep breathing to relax.

### 5. Readings

#### Strengtheninng the Student Toolbox - Study Strategies to Boost Learning, by John Dunlosky 

Items: pen/pencil, index cards, calendar. 

##### Most effective learning strategies:

* **Practice Testing**: boost long-term memory. Better tests require recall from memory, instead of merely asking to recognize the correct answer. Taking notes helps, e.g. keywords on one side of flash cards and correct answer on the other. 

* **Distributed Practice**: more effective than massed practice when something is repeated many times at the same time. 

##### Strategies with much promise:

* **Interleaved Practice**: practicing different types of problems across time. 

* **Elaborative Interrogation and Self-Explanation**: explain how new info is related to knowledge already learned.  

##### Less useful strategies (that are used a lot):

* Reareading and Highlighting: rereading has inconsistent effects on learning, and benefits may not be long-lasting. Highlighting is only the beginning of the journey, and should be used during restudying. 

* Summarization: may be useful if you know how to summarize. 

* Keyword Mnemonic and Imagery for Text: short-lived benefits only, and generating images for complex materials is hard. 


#### Notes on Note-Taking: Review of Research and Insights for Students and Instructors

* Avoid transcribing every words, take advantage of available lecture notes and **write in your own words**.
* **Review** notes the same day they are created and then on a regular basis.
* **Test** yourself on the content using flashcards or **Cornell Notes** methodology. 
* Carefully consider whether to takes notes on paper or electronically. 
* We are misled to believe that we know lecture content better than we actually do. Avoid the misperception!

![Cornell Note](http://coe.jmu.edu/learningtoolbox/images/noteb4.gif) 

![Cornell Note Example](http://coe.jmu.edu/learningtoolbox/images/notebook.gif)

Notes taking rely on (and tax) working memory. Generally notes are private and only meaningful to the note-taker. 

Linear vs **non-linear** format: non-linear styles use graphical representations, more effective as it facilitates making connections between ideas and strengthens long-term retention. 

Pen & paper vs. laptop: taking notes on paper is better if - writing in shorthands, non-linear style, forced to write in your own words. 

Reading handouts before lectures enhances learning, but reviewing instructor's notes is sub-optimal to reviewing your own notes. 

Learning occurs during construction and **review** of notes. Try to produce **summaries** and **test yourself** (e.g. cover notes and use keywords to retrieve info under Cornell setting) during reviews. **Review early and often**. 


#### This is the Kind of Music You Should Listen to at Work

The genre to choose, from classical music to dance beats, depends on what your work involves. 

"Listening to Mozart makes a person smarter." 

Music is a powerful tool - it increase efficiency and improves mental state - people will be more positive about the work. 

What you should listen:
* **Classical music**: if your work involves numbers or attention to details
* **Pop music**: if your work involve data entry or working to deadlines
* **Ambient music** (as ignorable as interesting): if your work involves solving equations
* **Dance music**: if your work involves proof-reading and problem solving
